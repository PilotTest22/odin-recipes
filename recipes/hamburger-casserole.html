                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>1 10oz can of tomato soup</li>

            <h2>Directions</h2>

                <ol>    
                    <li><strong>Step One</strong></li>
                        <p>Preheat the oven to<strong> 350</strong> degrees F (<strong>175</strong> degrees C).</p>
                    
                    <li><strong>Step Two</strong></li>
                        <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain pasta, reserving about 2 tablespoons pasta water.</p>

                    <li><strong>Step Three</strong></li>
                        <p>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Drain and discard grease.</p>

                    <li><strong>Step Four</strong></li>
                        <p>Place ground beef in a large round casserole dish. Add pasta on top; sprinkle with half the cheese. Pour tomato soup on top; add reserved pasta water and stir everything together well. Cover with foil.</p>

                    <li><strong>Step Five</strong></li>
                        <P>Bake in the preheated oven, covered, for 15 minutes. Uncover and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. Bake, uncovered, 10 minutes more.</P>

                    <li><strong>Step Six</strong></li>
                        <p>Turn on the ovenâ€™s broiler and set a rack 6 inches from the heat source. Broil casserole until cheese is browned, about 2 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve.</p>
